   - substring  Not Accept Naigitive Number , Never Mind The first Agrgument is Less than second Arguement otherwise it want to swap , Exclude last index
   - substr it is not recoginze it different in overload (start , length)
35- What is the syntax for an if/else conditional?
     -if(condtion)
         {
           // Code
